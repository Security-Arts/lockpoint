1. What Lockpoint is

Lockpoint is a public registry for recording personal decisions, commitments, and outcomes.

It allows users to:

create drafts,

lock decisions (irreversible),

append amendments and outcomes,

optionally make records public.

Lockpoint does not enforce behavior and does not guarantee results.

2. User responsibility

By using Lockpoint, you acknowledge that:

all decisions are made voluntarily;

you are fully responsible for your actions and outcomes;

Lockpoint does not verify truth, feasibility, or completion of any commitment.

3. Immutability

Once a record is locked:

it cannot be edited or deleted;

only amendments and outcomes may be added;

final outcomes cannot be changed.

This behavior is intentional.

4. Public records

If a record is marked as public:

it may be visible to anyone;

it may be indexed, shared, or referenced.

You are responsible for any content you choose to make public.

5. Prohibited use

You may not use Lockpoint to:

impersonate others;

post illegal content;

harass, threaten, or defame;

publish personal data of third parties without consent.

6. Availability

Lockpoint is provided “as is”.
We may change, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time.
